Version 0.5.4pre2 - 12 February 2014
- include more ADL6 stuff
- prepared miner to mine scrypt and nfactor scrypt
  --> option --scrypt => normal scrypt
  --> option --nscrypt => nfactor scrypt (e.g. execoin)


Version 0.5.3 - 2 February 2014
- changed automatic TC calculation
- increased max intensity to 21
- shaders are now used for intensity calculation
  --> option shaders is set: intensity calculation tries to align to shaders count (can increase performance but also decrease with low intensity)
  --> shaders NOT set: old cgminer intensity calculation is used
- opencl changed to keep speed with adaptive nfactor
- introduced first time dependent nfactor changes in code and opencl kernel (not finally done yet)
- fix for ADL with R9 cards


Version 0.5.2 - 21th January 2014
- reenabled optimized opencl kernel
- prepared opencl kernel for adaptive nFactor


Version 0.5.1 - 20th January 2014
- reenabled gpu-thread setting (not recommended, HW errors!)
- TC calculation changed (padding to 64 again instead of worksize)
- reverted scrypt opencl kernel to original cgminer version
- more output with --verbose


Version 0.5.0 - 17th January 2014
- fixed gpu-threads to 1
- changed automatic TC calcution
  - TC cannot be increased above max allocateable memory, should avoid issues during startup
- backport some fixes from cgminer
